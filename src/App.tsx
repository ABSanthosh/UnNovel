<h2>Introducing UnNovel</h2>
UnNovel is a half-baked, Notion style WYSIWYG editor that is built on top of TipTap(Another way of saying "I just copy-pasted the code from TipTap examples"). 
<br />
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Slash commands</li>
  <li>AI writing assistant</li>
  <li>No garbage</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h1>It also has AI! Wow! So cool! Yayy!</h1>
<br />

If you still don't get it, Its a parody of Novel, editor that is built on top of TipTap. 
Props to the creator of Novel, but he just copy-pasted the code from TipTap examples and a CodeSandBox(I'll add it in the readme). 
The main selling point, the AI auto complete, guess what, is also copied from Vercel docs. On top of that, it has some telemetry 
that sends data to his server whenever someone uses the slash command.

He advertised it soo much that it got to the top of Google search results. Twitter, Reddit, HackerNews, everywhere.
<br />
<br />
When I actually tried it, I was disappointed. The library was not very extensible, and the code was a mess. And when people opened issues,
<br />
<blockquote>
Oh good question, haven't dealt with multiple images before â€“ PRs welcome! ðŸ‘€
</blockquote>
<br />
<em>Sigh</em> I didn't want to deal with that. So I decided to make my own version of it. I'm not a good writer, so I'll just end it here.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Oh right, I added a AI assistant too. Just to show how lame and easy it is to add one. Go on and try.</h2>
